# Password-Generator-

## Project Description

The end goal for this project was to make a bug free password generator that was user friendly. This password generator allows users to choose the amount of characters they need for their password and choose if they would like symbols, uppercase, and/or lower case characters.

## Acceptance Criteria

WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
